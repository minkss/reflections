What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
  
  automatically can be not make that much sense.
  manually choose so you can decide a meaningful point to save a version.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

  I think it is because code can be ralated to each other,like html css and js files ,they usually work together.
  if you change something in a file like css ,you might also want to make some change in the html file,and these 
  changes are related to each other often,so this do make a lot of sense.
  
  for google docs,those files are usually work separately,so there is no need to commit all the files .  
    
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
  in the commond line ,type "git log" and you will see the commit history
  to see the changes between two commits ,use "git diff commit_previous commit_now"

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
  you can use "git checkout cimmit_ID" to restore to before that commit .
  that could be really useful.
  so you can really be confident to change your code without worring about it will
  make harm to the resposity.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
  maybe for writing html css js code .
  for my daily writing.
  it's cool!
